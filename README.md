Tvarit Assignment Task 1

Problem Statement:
Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13...19
inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teen. The input is passed as
command line arguments and output is to be printed on screen


The script app.py takes care of the solution. 
Provided inputs in format such as python app.py 1 2 3, we get the necessary answer.

The script involves checking the nnumbers for being numeric as well as exactly 3 numbers. It checks for the 'teen' numbers and 15,16 for following the necessary conditions.

The unittest can be run by this command, "python test.py"

The task requires no extra libraries, hence the empty requirements.txt
